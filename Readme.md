This parses the ASN.1 notation of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) as defined in ETSI ITS G5, to determine the size of CAM.
``cam_size.c`` outputs the size. Alter this file to create CAMs with different content, i.e. optional items, low frequency information etc.

Please see http://www.bastibl.net/etsi-cams/ for the motivation and further information.
